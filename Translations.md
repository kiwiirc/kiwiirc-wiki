Kiwi IRC supports multiple translations with the help of many volunteer translators. With these translations we can support people using IRC across the world and continue to make IRC easier to access for everybody.

When you first open Kiwi IRC your language will be auto detected from your browser settings, with an option to override this and select any language you are comfortable with.

*Note: Some messages and notifications are sent directly from the IRC network and cannot be translated.*

## How to help
We use a popular translation service, crowdin.com, that simplifies and allows non technical people to get involved with localising Kiwi IRC to their language.

You can find all the translations here: http://translations.kiwiirc.com

Most languages have already started to be translated but if you do not find your language in the list please send an email to the mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kiwiirc) asking to add your language.

It is important to keep a language fully translated as any untranslated phrases will use the English phrase instead!

## Using the translation service
Once you have created an account on http://translations.kiwiirc.com and found your language in the list, you are then free to look through the phrases and translate as needed. If there are any existing phrases that have been translated badly, you may leave a comment for that phrase suggesting an alternative.

### Important notes!
As you click through the phrases you will notice an "Other languages" tab. It is recommended that you take a look at the English version here to see the exact phrase you should be translating.

In some phrases you may see words wrapped in {}, such as "{{nick}}". These words will be replaced within Kiwi automatically and should not be translated here.

## Translation managers
Frequently active translators may be asked if they would like to become a translation manager or proof reader. These people have final say over correct translations and will approve correct phrases to be added to the final Kiwi IRC project. Since these people are also volunteers they often rely on the general public to translate too!

As new phrases become available these translation managers will receive an email explaining that some more translation is needed.
