## Overview
Kiwi IRC supports being themed by a CSS file and being changed at runtime. This gives you full access to modify colours, paddings, margins, etc. The core client layout is handled for you internally so you only need to think about the looks you want.

## Creating a theme
There isn't much to do when creating a theme.

- Copy an existing theme from `static/themes/` and name it however you like. For example, `mytheme.css`.
- Add it to your config file [as shown here](https://github.com/kiwiirc/kiwiirc/wiki/Configuration#themes)

Once these 2 steps are completed, refresh Kiwi IRC in your browser and you should now see your theme in the themes list in the settings window.

*Tip: You can click the refresh button next to the themes list to re-load your theme CSS without refreshing the page*
